An array is a fixed-size data structure that stores multiple elements of the same type. It is efficient in terms of memory and performance but lacks flexibility since its size cannot be changed after creation.

An ArrayList, on the other hand, is a resizable collection that dynamically adjusts as elements are added or removed. It offers built-in methods for easier data manipulation but comes with additional memory overhead and slightly slower performance due to resizing operations.

The main differences are that arrays have a fixed size and support primitive types, while ArrayLists can grow or shrink but only store objects. Arrays are ideal for performance-critical applications, whereas ArrayLists provide more convenience and flexibility.
